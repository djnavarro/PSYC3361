    "contents": "\nThe Psychology Research Internship is different from other courses you have taken thus far in your university career. There are no lectures, no tutorials, no exam, and no numbers. There is no “content” for you to know by the end of the session. You are entirely responsible for your own learning; the more you put in, the more you will get out of this experience.\nWoah, woah, woah you say… I get the no lectures, no tutorials, no exam, but what do you mean no numbers?? I mean that you will get more feedback in this course than you have received in your entire university career thus far, but we are not going to put a mark on anything.\n\n\nWhy? Richard Buckland has some inspiring ideas about this.\n\n“I think marks are a bit like sugar, if you add it to things people eat it. But if you take away the sugar, what’s going to make people eat things?” Richard Buckland\n\nRichard Buckland talks about when there are no marks, students are motivated by different things. Students like….\nthings that are interesting\nthings that are fun\nthings that are pleasurable\nthings that foster curiosity\nthe joy of learning\nhelping each other\nbeing part of a community\ncreating things\nsolving problems\ndoing puzzles\ncompetition\nchallenging themselves\ncollaborative learning\nThe internship is designed to tap into lots of the motivators on Richard’s list and to give you a go at the kinds of activities that researchers consider part of their job (thinking, writing, reflecting, presenting). By engaging in these activities, we want you to develop skills that will be relevant to you as an honours student and in your postgraduate career.\nResponding to feedback and striving to improve our performance is a big part of being a psychologist and you will receive detailed feedback on every piece of written work that you submit. But research has shown that feedback does not necessary promote learning, unless there is an opportunity to integrate that feedback to improve a piece of work. In this course, you will have the opportunity to write like academics do.\n\nHow writing works in the real world: Write a draft, get feedback, revise, submit, get feedback, revise, resubmit, get more feedback, revise again, resubmit again etc etc.\n\nGiven that you will have the opportunity to revise your work to improve it, marks are irrelevant in this course. Detailed (and critical) feedback will be given on each piece of writing, but numeric grades will not be released until final revisions are marked prior to exams.\nBut how do I know how I’m going?\nDon’t worry. You will always know where you are and what you need to do to improve. The head tutor will give feedback that highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of your work and is detailed enough that you will be able to judge the quality of your performance; we are just not going put a number or letter grade on it.\nTry and let go of the grade-driven mindset, for this course at least, and embrace feedback as an opportunity to develop your academic skills.\n\n\n\n",
