This week we are going to look at recent attempts to assess the the "reproducibility" of psychological science. There are 5 papers on our reading list this week. You will be assigned to read 1 of them and to write a [summary and reaction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XLi1DrYP9QdGKYYJ3j0Mr905puc8ml_YycB2RXdtlD4/edit?usp=sharing). Bring your S&R to workshop to share with the group who were assigned the same paper as you. 

In class, you will discuss the paper you have read in groups and then report back to the class.
